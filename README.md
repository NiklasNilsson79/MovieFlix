MovieFlix
This project serves as a sandbox for experimenting with JavaScript, enhancing API integration skills, and building an interactive, visually appealing web application.

MovieFlix is a project designed to practice and enhance my JavaScript skills by building a responsive web application for exploring movies and TV shows. This application interacts with The Movie Database (TMDb) API to fetch and display details about popular, top-rated, and upcoming content.
